# Applied Statistics
This repository contains all the work I completed for the Applied Statistics course, including the classes I attended and the final coursework. 

This course covered specialized models for continuous variables, such as Lognormal, Gamma, Weibull, Gumbel, and Pareto distributions. We also learned parameter estimation methods, including mean and variance estimation using the method of moments and maximum likelihood. We explored hypothesis testing for means, both with known and unknown variances. The course also dove into linear regression models, including simple and multiple regression, and provided an introduction to experimental statistics, with a focus on two-sample problems.
