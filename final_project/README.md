# Final Project for Applied Statistics

In this folder, you will find the final project for the Applied Statistics course
The following report aims to conduct a descriptive and regression analysis of a dataset related to the physicochemical properties of Vinho Verde wine grapes harvested in Portugal. We explore the relationships between variables to identify potential patterns or correlations, make point estimates of values of interest, compare different distribution models to assess their goodness of fit, and develop a regression model between a response variable and an explanatory variable.
